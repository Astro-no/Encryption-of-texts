# Encryption-of-texts
This was a python program to automate the caeser cipher  :- )

The The code starts by declaring the variables that will be used in the program. 
For each letter in the The code starts by declaring a variable called encodedmessage. 
This is where the user's input will be stored in order to be converted into an encrypted message.
The code then declares a variable called originalmessage, which will store the user's input so that it can be decrypted later on.
Next, it prompts for input again with a key value of int("Enter the key value: ").
The main function starts by asking for input from the user and then checks to see if it is equal to 'e' or 'd'. 
The code then asks the user for their key value, which is an integer that represents how many letters are in the alphabet.
The code starts by asking the user to enter a message. 
These functions take in a single parameter, which is either an input from the user (e) or an empty string ("").
The code starts by prompting the user for input, which is then assigned the value of "Enter the message to encode: " and lowercased.
The main function then takes in a single parameter, which is either an input from the user (e) or an empty string ("").
The code is a function that runs either the encode function or the decode function. 
The code then loops through all of the letters in the message and adds them to a list called encoded . 
These are used to convert the lists into strings so that they can be printed without having list format.

Lots of text, couldn't help it!
